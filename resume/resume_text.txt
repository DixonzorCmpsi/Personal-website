PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Penn State Nittany Ai Alliance
Ai Application Specialist June 2025 – present
Penn State University Park
• Developed an automated student analytics dashboard using Azure Container Apps and Power BI, orchestrating data synchronization between
SharePoint and the GitHub API via Power Automate.
• Researched and documented technical requirements for Nittany AI Advance projects, creating implementation roadmaps for student teams to
deliver on various projects deliverables (RAG, CNNs, PINNs) to partners including Lockheed Martin and West Shore Homes.
• Implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to streamline the deployment of API server scripts, ensuring continuous integration and
real-time updates for performance metrics.
• Built an internal AI development framework to streamline the construction of complex Ai pipelines for students, ranging from standard RAG
architectures to advanced Context-Augmented Generation (CAG) with state management.
• Developed a Python-based CLI tool to automate infrastructure provisioning across major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), standardizing
deployment workflows for student developers.
• Engineered an AI-driven code review system utilizing GitInjest for repository flattening and RAG for contextual analysis; reduced manual
review time by over 50% through advanced prompt engineering.
• Designed a multi-stage computer vision pipeline integrating Grounding DINO for object detection, SAM 2.1 for segmentation, and CLIP for
semantic embedding comparisons to achieve high-precision similarity matching with golden tickets. (student’s onboarding)

PROJECT EXPERIENCE
ML-Ops/Dev-OPS/Fine-tuning/Model Stacking
Fantasy football Prediction Ai web-app Oct 2025 – Dec 2025
• Developed a Stacked XGBoost Ensemble to predict NFL player performance (2012–2024), utilizing temporal lag features and Walk-Forward
Validation to minimize MAE across position-specific inference pipelines.
• Deployed a cron-scheduled ETL pipeline on GCP to ingest live weekly telemetry into PostgreSQL, establishing a scalable architecture for
continuous model retraining and longitudinal data retention.
Video Editing Tools
User friendly tool stack for content creators Aug 2025 – Sep 2025
• Developed and deployed a tool to download videos, audio, thumbnail and transcripts from social media using the ffmpeg library.
• Developed and deployed a full-stack web application that truncates silences in raw video footage, saving editors the time required to cut long
clips for productions.
